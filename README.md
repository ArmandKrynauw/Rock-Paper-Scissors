# rock-paper-scissors
A basic and advanced version of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The project was created from JetBrains Academy ([Project Page](https://hyperskill.org/projects/78?track=7)). Have fun playing!!


The basic versions of the game does not write the user ratings back to the file after the game has been played. It only reads the rating from the file at the start of the game.

Code still has to be written in the advanced version of the game to enable the program to write the user rating back to the file after the game has ended.
